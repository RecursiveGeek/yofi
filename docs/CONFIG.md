# Configuration Variables

Certain site-specific information is expected in configuration variables. 
The easiest way to set these is using environment variables. 
You could also treat them like [Secrets](./Secrets.md).

## Branding

These variables control how the brand of your specific site is presented.
It is not required to set them. Default codebase branding will be used if these are missing.

### Brand:Name

The simple brandname of your site. e.g. "YoMoney"

### Brand:Icon

The definition for your icon, using font-awesome, e.g. "fas fa-comment-dollar"

### Brand:Link

Url where you host your site, e.g. "https://www.yomoney.net/"

### Brand:Owner

Name of company or individual responsible for your site.
